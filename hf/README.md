# Hugging Face card source: staged, not published

This folder is the GitHub source for the two Hub twins of this repository:

- the Kernel Hub repo `kernels/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-receipt-attn` (what `get_kernel` loads);
- the model-type twin `SZLHOLDINGS/szl-receipt-attn`.

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `card.yaml` | The card source for **both** twins (plan decision D9: one source, one template). |
| `../CARD.md` | Its rendering by the shared [`hf-card`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/.github/tree/main/hf-card) toolkit. This is the file a mirror publishes as `README.md`. |
| `hub-import/` | The Hub cards exactly as the Hub served them, and `IMPORT.json`: the imported revisions, card digests, the full Hub file list of both twins, and how each Hub file compares with this repository. |

CI keeps them honest:

- `.github/workflows/hf-card.yml` fails when `CARD.md` drifts from `card.yaml`, or when the card breaks the card contract: front matter (`license`, `library_name: kernels`, `szl.source_repo`, `szl.proof_url`), and decision D10 (every `MEASURED` claim links a receipt pinned to a commit of this repository).
- `tests/test_hf_card_source.py` checks, offline, that `hub-import/` still holds the imported bytes and that `CARD.md` names this repository and its Apache-2.0 license.

To edit the card, change `card.yaml` and re-render:

```bash
python <hf-card>/render.py hf/card.yaml --out CARD.md
```

To refresh the import (read-only, anonymous public Hub API, no token):

```bash
python scripts/hf_hub_import.py fetch
```

## Publish status: blocked on owner actions

**Nothing in this repository writes the Hub.** Both twins still serve the cards in `hub-import/`; the Kernel Hub card has no front matter, so it carries no license tag. Publishing `CARD.md` needs all of:

1. **An HF credential for this repository.** Preferred: Trusted Publishers for `SZLHOLDINGS/szl-receipt-attn` and `kernels/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-receipt-attn`, bound to this repository's mirror workflow on `main`. Fallback: a repository secret `HF_TOKEN` scoped to those two repos. This repository has no HF secret today. (Owner action.)
2. **The shared mirror.** `reusable-hf-mirror.yml` (model and kernel targets) is not merged in `szl-holdings/.github`; workflow changes there wait for the owner's trust-root review. No copy-pasted mirror is added here in the meantime.
3. **A kernel write path.** `huggingface_hub` 2.0.0 refuses commits to `repo_type="kernel"`; Git is the only proven transport.

When those exist, a thin caller of the shared mirror publishes `CARD.md` as `README.md` to both twins, ships `LICENSE` (the kernel repo has none on the Hub, and the model twin's `LICENSE` differs from this repository's), and keeps the Hub-only receipts listed in `hub-import/IMPORT.json`. Until then, nobody edits these cards on the Hub.

## What the import shows

Read the numbers from `hub-import/IMPORT.json`; the points below are what they mean.

- **The Hub kernel build predates this tree.** It still ships the modules this repository removed (`api.py`, `const.py`, `ops.py`, `receipt.py`, `reference.py`, `selfcheck.py`, `triton_kernel.py`, `_ops.py`; see `tests/test_layout.py::test_superseded_modules_removed`), while `torch-ext/szl_receipt_attn/attn.py` is not on the Hub. The staged card describes this repository, so it must publish together with a build of this tree, never on its own.
- **Hub-only receipts.** `BENCH.laptop-blackwell.json` and `OPERATIONAL.json` exist only on the Hub. The staged card cites them as `REPORTED`, not `MEASURED`.
- **Other writers.** The model twin also carries `receipt_attn.py`, uploaded by `szl-holdings/a11oy` `atelier-hub-publish.yml` (a cross-writer the plan retires). Its card thumbnail `og-card.png` exists only on the Hub; the staged card does not reference it.
